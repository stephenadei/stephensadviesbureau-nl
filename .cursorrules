# Cursor Workflow Rules: Plan Mode vs Agent Mode

## When to Use Plan Mode

Use **Plan Mode** for:
- Architecture decisions and system design
- Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
- Initial project setup and scaffolding
- Major refactoring or restructuring
- Feature planning and strategy
- Tasks requiring review before execution

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Let's plan..."
- "How should we approach..."
- "Design a system for..."
- "Create a strategy for..."
- "What's the best way to..."
- "Brainstorm..."

**Benefits:**
- Prevents premature execution
- Allows review and approval before changes
- Better for complex decisions
- Reduces mistakes and rework

## When to Use Agent Mode

Use **Agent Mode** for:
- Implementation after planning is complete
- Iterative development and refinement
- Quick fixes and small changes
- Following established patterns
- Executing approved plans
- Simple tasks (< 3 steps)

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Implement..."
- "Build..."
- "Fix..."
- "Add..."
- "Update..." (when plan is clear)
- "Create..."
- "Let's build..."

**Benefits:**
- Faster iteration
- Immediate execution
- Better for straightforward tasks
- More efficient for routine work

## Workflow Optimization Guidelines

1. **Always start complex tasks in Plan Mode** - Get approval before major work
2. **Switch to Agent Mode after plan approval** - Execute once the approach is clear
3. **For simple tasks (< 3 steps), Agent Mode is fine** - Don't over-plan trivial work
4. **When user says "let's build" or "implement", use Agent Mode** - They're ready to execute
5. **If unsure, default to Plan Mode** - Better to plan first than redo work

## Example Workflows

**Complex Feature:**
1. User: "Let's add a booking system"
2. → Use Plan Mode: Design architecture, database schema, API routes
3. User approves plan
4. → Switch to Agent Mode: Implement the booking system

**Quick Fix:**
1. User: "Fix the typo on the contact page"
2. → Use Agent Mode: Directly fix the typo

**New Project:**
1. User: "Build a website for my consultancy"
2. → Use Plan Mode: Discuss approaches, tech stack, structure
3. User approves plan
4. → Switch to Agent Mode: Implement the website
